# Hotel Itemizer - MS Expense Integration

Automated hotel expense itemization for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Tomorrow: Run this single command to get everything started
python quick_setup.py
```

## 🎯 What This Does

1. **Extracts hotel invoice details** from PDF uploads using Azure OpenAI
2. **Categorizes charges** (Room, Meals, Incidentals, etc.) automatically  
3. **Calculates daily rates** and quantities for each category
4. **Automates MS Expense itemization** using browser automation
5. **Fills itemization forms** automatically in MS Expense

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ **Hotel PDF extraction** - Working
- ✅ **Web interface** - Working at http://localhost:5001/hotel-itemizer
- ✅ **MS Expense connection** - Working
- ✅ **Actions → Itemize automation** - Working
- 🔄 **Form field automation** - In progress (85% complete)

## 🛠 Manual Testing

If you want to test components individually:

```bash
# Start web app
python -m front_end.app

# Start debug browser (separate terminal)
python setup_debug_browser.py

# Test MS Expense automation
python ms_expense_itemizer.py

# Debug elements (if automation fails)
python debug_ms_expense_live.py
```
