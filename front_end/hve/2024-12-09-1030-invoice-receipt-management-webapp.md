# Invoice and Receipt Management Web Application

**Created**: 2024-12-09 10:30 UTC
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Requirements

Based on the `Instructions.md` file, the web application needs to support:

### 1. Downloading Expenses

- Button to import current expenses from a website
- Utilizes existing `expense_importer.py` file with `import_expense()` function

### 2. Displaying and Verifying Expenses

- Button to select and import CSV file containing expense data
- Display imported expenses in table format with all CSV columns
- Allow users to verify and edit expense data before finalizing

### 3. Matching Receipts and Expenses

- For each table row:
  - Add button to open file dialog for receipt selection (images/PDFs)
  - Enable drag-and-drop receipt files onto corresponding table rows
- Preview selected receipt files in corresponding rows
- Save receipt file paths in new table column
- Display confidence score for expense-receipt matches using `receipt_matcher.py` with `receipt_match_score()` function

### 4. Exporting Finalized Expenses

- Button to export finalized expenses (with matched receipts) to new CSV file

## Framework Selection Analysis

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Streamlit

**Pros:**

- Rapid prototyping and development
- Built-in file upload widgets and data display components
- Automatic reactive UI updates
- No need for separate frontend/backend development
- Great for data-centric applications
- Built-in support for pandas DataFrame display

**Cons:**

- Limited customization of UI components
- Drag-and-drop functionality requires custom components or workarounds
- Less control over exact user experience and interactions
- Session state management can be complex for multi-step workflows
- Limited flexibility for complex table editing interactions
- Difficult to implement custom receipt preview layouts

#### Option 2: Flask + HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Pros:**

- Full control over UI/UX design and interactions
- Native support for drag-and-drop functionality
- Flexible table editing with custom JavaScript
- Better control over file upload and preview workflows
- Can create professional, responsive designs
- Easier integration with existing Python modules
- RESTful API design allows for future mobile/desktop app integration

**Cons:**

- More development time required
- Need to handle frontend and backend separately
- More complex setup and configuration

#### Option 3: FastAPI + React/Vue

**Pros:**

- Modern, high-performance API framework
- Automatic API documentation
- Type hints and validation
- Excellent for scalable applications

**Cons:**

- Overkill for this use case
- Requires knowledge of frontend frameworks
- Much longer development time

### Decision: Flask + HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Rationale:**
Given the specific requirements, Flask is the optimal choice because:

1. **Drag-and-Drop Requirements**: The application needs sophisticated drag-and-drop functionality for receipts onto table rows, which is challenging to implement elegantly in Streamlit
2. **Custom Table Interactions**: Need for inline editing, receipt previews, and file attachment per row requires custom UI controls
3. **Professional UI**: Requirements suggest a polished, professional interface rather than a prototype
4. **Integration Flexibility**: Flask provides clean separation that makes it easier to integrate with existing `expense_importer.py` and `expense_matcher.py` modules
5. **Future Extensibility**: RESTful API design allows for potential mobile app or desktop integration later

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (chosen for flexibility and control)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla or with minimal libraries)
- **File Handling**: Python's built-in libraries + existing codebase
- **CSV Processing**: pandas (likely already available)

### Key Files to Create

- `front_end/app.py` - Main Flask application
- `front_end/templates/index.html` - Main application template
- `front_end/static/css/style.css` - Application styling
- `front_end/static/js/app.js` - Frontend JavaScript functionality
- `front_end/routes/` - API route handlers
- `front_end/tests/` - Unit and integration tests

### Integration Points

- **Existing `expense_importer.py`**: Will be imported and `import_expense()` called from Flask route
- **Existing `receipt_matcher.py`**: Will be imported and `receipt_match_score()` called for confidence calculations
