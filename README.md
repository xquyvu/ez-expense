# Hyper Velocity Expense

Get your expenses done in just a few clicks (using AI of course).

## Introduction

Doing the expenses is boring and painful.

For every expense item, you need to identify the matching receipt files, whose names
very often do not indicate what they are about. Then, uploads the the receipts one at a
time, filling in details on a tool that is slow, unresponsive, and error prone.

What if you could just, give the receipts to someone and say "Go figure it out"?

This tool lets you do exactly just that. It uses AI and automation to parse the
receipts, match them to the correct expense lines, then go and fill in the expense
report without you needing to do a single thing.

Just click the app, and it just works. No installation required, no coding involve.

## ðŸ“¥ Download and use

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/xquyvu/ez-expense/releases)
2. Download the latest ZIP corresponding to your platform. This contains the executable file and all necessary dependencies.
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Fill in the content of the `.env.template` file, and rename it to `.env`

Refer to the [USER GUIDE](deployment/USER_GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to use the app, and common issues.

**IMPORTANT:** You will need to provide your OpenAI API key to the app. Follow the instructions in the User Guide to set it up.

### For MacOS

This app is not code-signed (requires $99/year Apple Developer Account). macOS will show a security warning, but you can safely bypass it by right-clicking the app and selecting "Open", or using:

```bash
# After installing the app, replace this with the path to where you extracted the zip file
/usr/bin/xattr -cr <path_to_your_extracted_package>/EZ-Expense.app
/usr/bin/xattr -cr <path_to_your_extracted_package>/ez-expense
```

## TODO

- Use another name for .env.template, like openai_config.json
- Test when there are no existing expenses
- Instructions to set up Azure OpenAI, create subscription etc.
- Improve UX for people without AzureOpenAI / subscription etc.
- Find other ports if the current ones are not available
- Make names consistent (HVE, EZ-Expense, Hyper Velocity Expense)
- Add one-shot mode
- Tidy up the repo
- Test on Linux
- Check if the tests are still valid
