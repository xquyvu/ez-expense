# Easy expense

Get your expenses done in just a few clicks (using AI of course).

## Introduction

Doing the expenses is boring and painful.

For every expense item, you need to identify the matching receipt files, whose names
very often do not indicate what they are about. Then, uploads the the receipts one at a
time, filling in details on a tool that is slow, unresponsive, and error prone.

What if you could just, give the receipts to someone and say "Go figure it out"?

This tool lets you do exactly just that. It uses AI and automation to parse the
receipts, match them to the correct expense lines, then go and fill in the expense
report without you needing to do a single thing.

Just click the app, and it just works. No installation required, no coding involve.
